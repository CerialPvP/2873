# 2873 Repository

2873 is a kitpvp server where there is a lot of fun.
Basically, I made this repository to __regularly update skripts here.__
You can find them in the **skripts** folder.

# How to update skripts?

There are 2 ways.

## The first way

Just go to the scripts folder, go to the updater skript, put that in your server
and then execute /update <skript name> ingame. The skript will fetch the wanted skript from the releases tab and
it will download to 2873, then it will reload.
  
## The second way

Just go to the scripts folder in the repository, then you can go to the wanted skript, go to it,
copy and paste it to 2873, and reload.
  
# Peace!
